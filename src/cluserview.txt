A clusterview is an opengl viewer for spikes. We take in a pointer to
a GLSPVectpList, a list of pointers to vectors containing spike
points.

We always consider the last (head) of the list to be the "Current" set
of spike points. As new spikes arrive, they are added to the current
(head) spike point vector. Once every T time units, that vector ends,
and is put on the list; at that point we composite using the
accumulation buffer for fading purposes.

At the moment, there is hardly any optimizaton; in particular there
are a lot of superfluous copies going on.
