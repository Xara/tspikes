The ClusterRenderer abstracts away all of the necessary cluster
rendering operations that manipulate the openGL state machine. The
goal is to have a GL-framework-independent mechanism for rendering
spike/cluster points.

We take in a pointer to a sorted container of spike point vectors. 

Each spike point vector can easily be rendered as a vertex array,
accelerating the rendering process. We use the accumulation buffer to
accumulate / fade previous spike points. As new points arrive, we
render them on top of the current accumulation buffer -- once we are
done with this particular spike point vector, we fade the current
accumulation buffer and render it into the buffer.

[ this needs a better explanation]
