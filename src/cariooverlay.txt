We want to be able to render text (or any cairo-thingie) to a given
either pixel range or what. We just want to make sure that there's a
1:1 pixel/screen correspondence.

We want a function that will keep a list of cairo-rendered textures
and quads and render those in the scene. It's actually a bit tricky,
because how do we handle the obvious scaling issues?

So, cairo surfaces will always be rendered 1:1. 

so we pick a point (pixels, or float) and render the text. 

We'd like to be able to render text for vertical text. 

We create a list of smart pointers of objects. 

So each cairo renderer object has: 

1. coordinates in either real or pixel coord
2. 


-----------------------------
How do we manipulate text strings? 

The set of string objects has a "render" object

GLString("text")
Glstring.setText
GLstring.setPosition(real val, real val); 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
two problems: we can't pick the texture size in advance that we're
going to render the cairo text to, right? I guess we could render, and
if the extents are too small, rerender (good idea!)
