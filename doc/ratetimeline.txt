we have:

setMinorTick
setMajorTick

isLive_ : when true, activePos_ follows the end of the array; this gives stripchart-like
behavior. isLive in no way impacts our active viewing window, defined
by [t1, t2, x1, x2]

activePos_ : the position (t) value that is the most-recent that we
are selecting/enabling or passing up to higher levels. Not really
happy with the name. activePos_ follows the end of the data when isLive is true

decayRate_: luminance/alpha drops per unit time; for example, a decayRate
of 0 means that we never decay.

render complexities

Now we had originally planned on having this data slowly accumulate
over time, "squishing" old data. This fails on two counts:
   a. it looks ugly
   b. it provides no information wrt the timeline of what you're looking at. 

So it seems the smarter thing to do is have several possible zoom
settings, and optionally let people scroll through things. Yes, it's
more complex, but it's also a better UI.
