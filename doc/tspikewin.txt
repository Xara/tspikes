Tspikewin creates the GLSPvectPlist out of inbound TSpikes
Segmentation comes from assertion of SetTime()

we will have a clusterSetTimeWindow(t1, t2) function that will 
set the time to view data from t1 to t2
   it does this by querying the internal SPVectTimeIndex_ function, which
   is a map from time to a spiter
