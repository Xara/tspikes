what do we want to do ? How do we want to abstract away the notion of
a remote data source and a remote data control point?

Data input: 
   Spikes from a source

Event control associated with data source: 
   set settings  
   settingsChanged()

Generic Event Control:
   time()

Let's just write the damn thing and worry about the most parsimonious
design later.



Now, somehow this has to get called from the primary glib loop when
either events or data arrive.
