A SpikeWaveView lets you look at the spike waveforms for a particular
channel. 

 * it is passed and renders tspikes waveforms for its particular channel
    newSpikeWave(A new GLSpikeWave_t)    
    
 * it plots the current settings/state for a given channel :
    setTime(uint_t ) :
    updateChannelState(ChanState_t ) :

 * it has internal view state, such as amplitude
    setAmplitudeView(min, max): set's the amplitude range you can currently see

    amplitudeViewSignal(min, max) signal emitted when amp view changes
    
 * and support methods: 

    setListLen() : internal buffer size

    setLive() : whether or not we're actively rendering

    invalidate() : invalidate and rerender whole window; generally
    should not be used, as other state changes will dirty the window.
